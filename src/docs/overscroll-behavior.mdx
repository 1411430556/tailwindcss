## 示例

### 防止父元素过度滚动

使用 `overscroll-contain` 工具类，可以防止目标区域的滚动触发父元素的滚动，但在支持的操作系统中保留滚动超过容器末尾时的“弹跳”效果：

<Figure hint="滚动以查看行为">

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="h-48 space-y-4 overflow-auto overscroll-contain p-8 text-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
      <p
        children={`
      Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
      one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything
      to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy,
      making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
      What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let
      me give you a hint, junior.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure,
      we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down,
      opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
      drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
      Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?`}
      />
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:overscroll-contain] -->
<div class="overscroll-contain ...">嗯，让我告诉你一些事情，...</div>
```

</Figure>

### 防止过度滚动弹跳

使用 `overscroll-none` 工具类，可以防止目标区域的滚动触发父元素的滚动，同时避免滚动超过容器末尾时的“弹跳”效果：

<Figure hint="滚动以查看行为">

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="h-48 space-y-4 overflow-auto overscroll-none p-8 text-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
      <p
        children={`
      Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
      one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything
      to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy,
      making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
      What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let
      me give you a hint, junior.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure,
      we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down,
      opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
      drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
      Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?`}
      />
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:overscroll-none] -->
<div class="overscroll-none ...">嗯，让我告诉你一些事情，...</div>
```

### 使用默认的过度滚动行为

使用 `overscroll-auto` 工具类，使用户在到达主要滚动区域的边界时，能够继续滚动父滚动区域：

<Figure hint="滚动以查看行为">

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="h-48 space-y-4 overflow-auto overscroll-auto p-8 text-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
      <p
        children={`
      Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
      one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything
      to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy,
      making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
      What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let
      me give you a hint, junior.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure,
      we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down,
      opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
      drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
      Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?`}
      />
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:overscroll-auto] -->
<div class="overscroll-auto ...">嗯，让我告诉你一些事情，...</div>
```
